\chapter{Our work - Contribution}

\section{Our definition(s?) of robustness}
Probably just average of pair results (non diagonal in case of same sets).
Maybe percentage of pairs who surpassed some threshold reward?

\section{Population construction}

\subsection{SP agents initialization}
\textbf{One agent is not enough?}

\subsection{population partner sampling during training}
\textbf{See if playing with whole population at once differs from one random partner for episode}

\subsection{Final agent training}

\section{Diverzification}
\textbf{maximize kl divergence among population partners policies}

\subsection{Population policies difference rewards augmentation}

\subsection{Population policies difference loss}
