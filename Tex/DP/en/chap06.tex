\section{Utilized framework}
\subsection*{Comparision of rllib and StableBaselines3}
Rllib framework was used in original paper, however for our usages stable baselines seemed sufficient and reasonably easy to extend.
Stable baselines has no explicit support of multi-agent environments.
\subsection{Modifications of stable baselines}
\par
\textbf{CNN policy wrapper,}
\textbf{Partner embedded into environment}

\subsection{NN structure modification}

\subsection{Hyperparameters random search}

\subsection{Randomization function correction}

\section{Self-play}
\subsection{Training}
\subsection{Results}
