\chapter{Our contribution}

\section{Utilized framework}
\subsection*{Comparision of rllib and StableBaselines3}
Rllib framework was used in original paper, however for our usages stable baselines seemed sufficient and reasonably easy to extend.
Stable baselines has no explicit support of multi-agent environments.
\subsection*{Essential modifications of stable baselines}
By default SB3 comes with various wrappers to support most of common environment settings, including 

\subsection*{Essential modifications of stable baselines}
Initializing methods that resets environment did not yield correct initial positions for some maps.

\section{Robustness metric}
Defining our own metric for robust cooperation of two sets of agents. Probably just average of pair results (non diagonal in case of same sets).
Maybe number of pairs who surpassed some threshold?
