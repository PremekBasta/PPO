First of all, I would like to thank my beloved wife, Adéla, who carried me through most of my master's studies and especially during the writing of this thesis, provided me with endless words of motivation and encouragement, and created an overall nurturing work environment.
I would also like to thank my mother for her lifelong encouragement.

A big thank you goes to my wonderful supervisor Martin, who not only actively supported me during the time we worked on this thesis, but also inspired me to pursue nature-inspired science and multi-agent systems in the first place.
I would also like to thank Milan Straka, whose amazing courses on Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning made it possible for me to dive deeper into the field through this thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank the MetaCentrum (MetaVO) organization for providing me with cluster computing resources, which made all the necessary computations possible.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Over the past few decades, we have witnessed great successes in the field of deep and reinforcement learning.
Great achievements have been made in many competitive settings, both in single-agent and multi-agent environments, where AI has managed to outperform human experts and even entire teams of human experts.
However, the situation is much more difficult when cooperation is required in purely cooperative environments.
We first give a brief overview of reinforcement learning theory and it's current state of the art algorithms.
We then extend the theory to multi-agent systems, where several related issues are discussed.
And finally, we propose novel approaches of agent training where we use a simplified multi-agent cooperative cooking game environment based on the popular game Overcooked, we attempt to train agents that are robust and capable of ad hoc agent cooperation.
